#roseLibrary

##Intro
>roseLibrary is the most beautiful and majestic GUI library.Now it is in developing by only one student(with poor English).
I used all kinds of GUI library once such as Qt to create GUI application.But I don't like the style of Qt programming such as moc and emmit.I even wanted to use electron(GitHub's staff) but the love of C++ maked me not.So...Create your own GUI library just like chrome!Since here this idea of roseLibrary appeared in my mind.
It will use the most unbelievable tec and will be the most beautiful,most majestic,most useful,easiest GUI library.Join us!You won't be disappointed! 

##Build
Well,at first I just wanted to use lovely Makefile but...Because of the idleness I used the IDE...
To build it,you should have cairo.lib,cairo.dll and cairo.h and put them in their own folds(library,bin\Debug or include).
Then please open the roseLibrary.cbp by Code::Blocks.And press F9 or touch "Build".It's OK!
